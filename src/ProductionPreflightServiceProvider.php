     * Lay the shipped defaults under a published config file, all the way down.
     *
     * Laravel's own `mergeConfigFrom()` is a single `array_merge` at the top level, so it asks
     * one question per top-level key: is it there? A host that published the config file has
     * every top-level key, so a key that a later release adds inside one of those blocks would
     * never arrive, and the block the host published would win whole.
     *
     * Nothing would error or log: the new setting would read as `null` (or as `[]`). A feature
     * added in a minor release would be off for exactly the hosts that customized that area, and
     * a corrected security default would not take effect, for as long as the host keeps the file
     * it published.
     *
     * Recursion stops at a list on either side, because a list is a value, not a structure.
     * `array_merge_recursive()` concatenates lists and `array_replace_recursive()` merges them by
     * index: a host narrowing a shipped `['web', 'api']` to `['admin']` gets back
     * `['web', 'api', 'admin']` from the first and `['admin', 'api']` from the second. Both hand
     * back an entry the host removed, which on an allowlist is a security regression. Here the
     * published list stands as written.
     *
     * `array_is_list([])` is true, which is the behavior wanted here: an empty array is a host
     * saying "none", and descending into it could only re-introduce what it emptied.
     *
     * A host with a cached config is never merged at all, by the framework's design. For those
     * installations the published file is the whole truth, so a package that reads a nested key
     * needs its read-site fallback to agree with the shipped default. The two are halves of one
     * guarantee.
